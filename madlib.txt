Mad Lib for TIY

Since I use my computer every day, it can get ADJ really ADV.  I always
make sure VRB it every # days in order to keep it shiny and ADJ.  I'll
grab a soft NOUN from the ROOM and ADV wipe the keyboard down to get
ride of all the NOUNS.  The I squirt some LIQUOD on the screen to get it
nice and ADJ.  This week, it was extra dirty because my little PET
NAME decided to bring a dead ANML into my room and eat it at
my desk.  When I yelled EXCL and told him to stop, he stuck out his
BODYPART at me and continued VRB-ING.  Then he started VRB-ING so hard
that he spilled all of his FOODS all over my NOUN.  That is the last
time I'll let my ADJ little pet in my room ever again!
